## III. Insights
- Customers who register and place their first order in July 2017 have a high retention rate (up to 48.1%) after 5 months of operation.
- Customers who register and place their first order in April 2017 have a stable and relatively high retention rate: 45.1% (4th month), 42.1% (5th month) ), and 42.7% (7th month).
- Customers who register and place their first order in May 2021 also have a fairly high and stable retention rate: 40.4%,39%, and 41.3% in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th month activities.
- Looking at the above insights, we can see that customers who start ordering from mid-year 4,5,6,7,8 tend to order stable, and relatively higher than the rest months of the year.
- Customers who place orders at the beginning of January and February only show stability, nothing special.
- KPMG's year-to-date retention rate is quite good, all 30% or more (except 1st month at 25.5%).
## IV. Recommendations
- There should be attractive preferential policies for customers in the first months of the year to increase the order rate (retention) over the months.
- The Mid-year months have higher retention rates than other months -> need to dive into why (with relevant data, visualization of other data) to apply to other months of the year.
